## 📚 What I Learned

With this project, I reinforced and improved concepts from my previous work:

- Better project preparation before pushing to a repository
- Cleaner folder organization using Vite
- Improved Sass architecture and responsibility distribution
- More structured separation of layout and styling concerns
- Writing cleaner and more modular SCSS files
- Smoother Git workflow from local development to remote repository

This project focused more on refining structure and workflow rather than learning entirely new technologies.

## 📌 Responsiveness

This landing page is currently optimized for desktop screens (~1536px width).  
It was designed as a desktop-focused layout and is not intended for mobile devices at this stage.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Make the design fully responsive
- Add advanced animations
- Implement shopping cart functionality
- Improve accessibility (ARIA, contrast, semantic HTML)
- Enhance SEO optimization
